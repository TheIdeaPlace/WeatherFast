; Inno Setup script for WeatherFast (Windows).
;
; Per-user install (no administrator rights) into %LocalAppData%, so the in-app
; updater can download and run a new installer without elevation - mirroring the
; per-user model QuickMail uses via Velopack. The version is passed by the CI
; build with /DMyAppVersion=x.y.z; it defaults to 0.0.0 for local test compiles.
;
; Build locally (after `python build.py` in ../windows):
;   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DMyAppVersion=1.1 weatherfast.iss

[Code]
// Force-close any WeatherFast process still holding the installed executable.
// (Comments here use // rather than braces: Inno's brace comments do not nest,
// so an {app}-style constant inside one would terminate it early.)
//
// AppMutex and CloseApplications are not sufficient when upgrading from a 3.0.x
// one-file build. Those ran a bootloader parent plus a Python child, and only
// the child created WeatherFastRunning - so once it exited the mutex was gone
// even though the parent was still alive holding the .exe open, parked on the
// bootloader's "Failed to remove temporary directory" dialog. Restart Manager
// cannot shift that either: a process whose message loop has already ended does
// not act on the WM_CLOSE that CloseApplications sends. The result was setup
// failing with "DeleteFile failed; code 5. Access is denied."
//
// Killing it is safe here: in that state the application has finished its work
// and is only displaying a shutdown warning. A genuinely running instance is
// still caught earlier by AppMutex, which prompts the user first.
