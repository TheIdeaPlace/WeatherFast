## Expected Precipitation

A precipitation forecast timeline showing intensity over the coming hours. Enable in **Settings → Features**. Access via the Actions menu on any city.

The timeline is a visual chart for sighted users. VoiceOver users can explore the same data through the audio graph below it, which provides tones representing intensity and individual data points accessible by swiping.

## Weather Icons

Icons change between day and night for the two clearest conditions:

| Condition | Day | Night |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Clear sky / Mainly clear | ☀️ Sun | 🌙 Moon with stars |
| Partly cloudy | 🌤 Cloud with sun | ☁️🌙 Cloud with moon |
| Overcast | ☁️ Cloud | ☁️ Cloud |
| Fog / Depositing rime fog | Fog cloud | Fog cloud |
| Drizzle (light/moderate/dense) | Drizzle cloud | Drizzle cloud |
| Freezing drizzle / Freezing rain | Sleet cloud | Sleet cloud |
| Slight / Moderate / Heavy rain | Rain cloud | Rain cloud |
| Snow fall / Snow grains / Snow showers | Snow cloud | Snow cloud |
| Rain showers (slight/moderate/violent) | Heavy rain cloud | Heavy rain cloud |
| Thunderstorm / with hail | Lightning cloud | Lightning cloud |

VoiceOver always announces the exact condition by name (e.g., "Conditions: Clear sky"). The icon is decorative and hidden from VoiceOver.

## Accessibility

FastWeather is designed primarily for VoiceOver users.

- All features are accessible without seeing the screen
- Descriptive, context-aware VoiceOver labels throughout
- Weather icons are decorative — conditions are always announced by name
- Dynamic Type supported — text scales with your system font size setting
- High contrast — readable in all lighting conditions
- VoiceOver custom actions for city reordering (Move Up, Move Down, Move to Top, Move to Bottom)
- VoiceOver table rotor navigation in Table view

**Why doesn't the UV Index show at night?**
UV radiation only exists during daylight hours. The field is hidden automatically when the API reports nighttime (`is_day = 0`).

**What's the difference between Daylight Duration and Sunshine Duration?**
Daylight Duration is the total time from sunrise to sunset. Sunshine Duration is expected hours of actual direct sunlight. If sunshine duration is much lower than daylight, expect mostly cloudy skies.

**The hourly forecast seems to start at the wrong time.**
The forecast is based on your device's current time and the city's local time zone. Ensure your device clock is correct.

**I want to reset everything.**
Go to **Settings → Data Management** and use **Clear All Cities** and/or **Reset Settings to Default**.
